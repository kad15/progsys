NAME
       BASH - GNU BOURNE-AGAIN SHELL

SYNOPSIS
       BASH [OPTIONS] [COMMAND_STRING | FILE]

COPYRIGHT
       BASH IS COPYRIGHT (C) 1989-2013 BY THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.

DESCRIPTION
       BASH  IS  AN  SH-COMPATIBLE  COMMAND LANGUAGE INTERPRETER THAT EXECUTES
       COMMANDS READ FROM THE STANDARD INPUT OR FROM A FILE.  BASH ALSO INCOR‐
       PORATES USEFUL FEATURES FROM THE KORN AND C SHELLS (KSH AND CSH).

       BASH  IS  INTENDED  TO  BE A CONFORMANT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SHELL AND
       UTILITIES PORTION  OF  THE  IEEE  POSIX  SPECIFICATION  (IEEE  STANDARD
       1003.1).  BASH CAN BE CONFIGURED TO BE POSIX-CONFORMANT BY DEFAULT.

OPTIONS
       ALL  OF  THE  SINGLE-CHARACTER SHELL OPTIONS DOCUMENTED IN THE DESCRIP‐
       TION OF THE SET BUILTIN COMMAND CAN BE USED AS OPTIONS WHEN  THE  SHELL
       IS INVOKED.  IN ADDITION, BASH INTERPRETS THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS WHEN IT
       IS INVOKED:

       -C        IF THE -C OPTION IS PRESENT, THEN COMMANDS ARE READ FROM  THE
                 FIRST NON-OPTION ARGUMENT COMMAND_STRING.  IF THERE ARE ARGU‐
                 MENTS AFTER THE COMMAND_STRING,  THEY  ARE  ASSIGNED  TO  THE
                 POSITIONAL PARAMETERS, STARTING WITH $0.
       -I        IF THE -I OPTION IS PRESENT, THE SHELL IS INTERACTIVE.
       -L        MAKE BASH ACT AS IF IT HAD BEEN INVOKED AS A LOGIN SHELL (SEE
                 INVOCATION BELOW).
       -R        IF THE -R OPTION IS PRESENT,  THE  SHELL  BECOMES  RESTRICTED
                 (SEE RESTRICTED SHELL BELOW).
       -S        IF  THE -S OPTION IS PRESENT, OR IF NO ARGUMENTS REMAIN AFTER
                 OPTION PROCESSING, THEN COMMANDS ARE READ FROM  THE  STANDARD
                 INPUT.   THIS  OPTION  ALLOWS THE POSITIONAL PARAMETERS TO BE
                 SET WHEN INVOKING AN INTERACTIVE SHELL.
       -D        A LIST OF ALL DOUBLE-QUOTED STRINGS PRECEDED BY $ IS  PRINTED
                 ON  THE STANDARD OUTPUT.  THESE ARE THE STRINGS THAT ARE SUB‐
                 JECT TO LANGUAGE TRANSLATION WHEN THE CURRENT LOCALE IS NOT C
                 OR  POSIX.   THIS  IMPLIES THE -N OPTION; NO COMMANDS WILL BE
                 EXECUTED.
       [-+]O [SHOPT_OPTION]
                 SHOPT_OPTION IS ONE OF THE  SHELL  OPTIONS  ACCEPTED  BY  THE
                 SHOPT   BUILTIN  (SEE  SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  BELOW).   IF
                 SHOPT_OPTION IS PRESENT, -O SETS THE VALUE OF THAT OPTION; +O
                 UNSETS  IT.   IF  SHOPT_OPTION IS NOT SUPPLIED, THE NAMES AND
                 VALUES OF THE SHELL OPTIONS ACCEPTED BY SHOPT ARE PRINTED  ON
                 THE  STANDARD  OUTPUT.   IF  THE INVOCATION OPTION IS +O, THE
                 OUTPUT IS DISPLAYED IN A FORMAT THAT MAY BE REUSED AS INPUT.
       --        A -- SIGNALS THE END OF OPTIONS AND DISABLES  FURTHER  OPTION
                 PROCESSING.   ANY ARGUMENTS AFTER THE -- ARE TREATED AS FILE‐
                 NAMES AND ARGUMENTS.  AN ARGUMENT OF - IS EQUIVALENT TO --.

       BASH ALSO  INTERPRETS  A  NUMBER  OF  MULTI-CHARACTER  OPTIONS.   THESE
       OPTIONS  MUST  APPEAR  ON  THE COMMAND LINE BEFORE THE SINGLE-CHARACTER
       OPTIONS TO BE RECOGNIZED.

       --DEBUGGER
              ARRANGE FOR THE DEBUGGER PROFILE TO BE EXECUTED BEFORE THE SHELL
              STARTS.   TURNS  ON EXTENDED DEBUGGING MODE (SEE THE DESCRIPTION
              OF THE EXTDEBUG OPTION TO THE SHOPT BUILTIN BELOW).
       --DUMP-PO-STRINGS
              EQUIVALENT TO -D, BUT THE OUTPUT IS IN THE GNU GETTEXT PO  (POR‐
              TABLE OBJECT) FILE FORMAT.
       --DUMP-STRINGS
              EQUIVALENT TO -D.
       --HELP DISPLAY  A  USAGE  MESSAGE  ON STANDARD OUTPUT AND EXIT SUCCESS‐
              FULLY.
       --INIT-FILE FILE
       --RCFILE FILE
              EXECUTE COMMANDS FROM FILE INSTEAD OF THE SYSTEM  WIDE  INITIAL‐
              IZATION FILE /ETC/BASH.BASHRC AND THE STANDARD PERSONAL INITIAL‐
              IZATION FILE ~/.BASHRC IF THE SHELL IS INTERACTIVE (SEE  INVOCA‐
              TION BELOW).

       --LOGIN
              EQUIVALENT TO -L.

       --NOEDITING
              DO  NOT  USE THE GNU READLINE LIBRARY TO READ COMMAND LINES WHEN
              THE SHELL IS INTERACTIVE.

       --NOPROFILE
              DO NOT READ EITHER THE SYSTEM-WIDE STARTUP FILE /ETC/PROFILE  OR
              ANY   OF  THE  PERSONAL  INITIALIZATION  FILES  ~/.BASH_PROFILE,
              ~/.BASH_LOGIN, OR ~/.PROFILE.   BY  DEFAULT,  BASH  READS  THESE
              FILES  WHEN  IT  IS  INVOKED  AS  A  LOGIN SHELL (SEE INVOCATION
              BELOW).

       --NORC DO NOT READ AND EXECUTE  THE  SYSTEM  WIDE  INITIALIZATION  FILE
              /ETC/BASH.BASHRC  AND THE PERSONAL INITIALIZATION FILE ~/.BASHRC
              IF THE SHELL IS INTERACTIVE.  THIS OPTION IS ON  BY  DEFAULT  IF
              THE SHELL IS INVOKED AS SH.

       --POSIX
              CHANGE  THE BEHAVIOR OF BASH WHERE THE DEFAULT OPERATION DIFFERS
              FROM THE POSIX STANDARD TO MATCH THE STANDARD (POSIX MODE).  SEE
              SEE  ALSO  BELOW  FOR A REFERENCE TO A DOCUMENT THAT DETAILS HOW
              POSIX MODE AFFECTS BASH'S BEHAVIOR.

       --RESTRICTED
              THE SHELL BECOMES RESTRICTED (SEE RESTRICTED SHELL BELOW).

       --VERBOSE
              EQUIVALENT TO  -V.

       --VERSION
              SHOW VERSION INFORMATION FOR THIS INSTANCE OF BASH ON THE  STAN‐
              DARD OUTPUT AND EXIT SUCCESSFULLY.

ARGUMENTS
       IF ARGUMENTS REMAIN AFTER OPTION PROCESSING, AND NEITHER THE -C NOR THE
       -S OPTION HAS BEEN SUPPLIED, THE FIRST ARGUMENT IS ASSUMED  TO  BE  THE
       NAME  OF  A FILE CONTAINING SHELL COMMANDS.  IF BASH IS INVOKED IN THIS
       FASHION, $0 IS SET TO THE NAME OF THE FILE, AND THE POSITIONAL  PARAME‐
       TERS  ARE SET TO THE REMAINING ARGUMENTS.  BASH READS AND EXECUTES COM‐
       MANDS FROM THIS FILE, THEN EXITS.  BASH'S EXIT STATUS IS THE EXIT  STA‐
       TUS  OF  THE  LAST  COMMAND EXECUTED IN THE SCRIPT.  IF NO COMMANDS ARE
       EXECUTED, THE EXIT STATUS IS 0.  AN ATTEMPT IS FIRST MADE TO  OPEN  THE
       FILE IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY, AND, IF NO FILE IS FOUND, THEN THE SHELL
       SEARCHES THE DIRECTORIES IN PATH FOR THE SCRIPT.

INVOCATION
       A LOGIN SHELL IS ONE WHOSE FIRST CHARACTER OF ARGUMENT ZERO IS A -,  OR
       ONE STARTED WITH THE --LOGIN OPTION.

       AN  INTERACTIVE  SHELL  IS ONE STARTED WITHOUT NON-OPTION ARGUMENTS AND
       WITHOUT THE -C OPTION WHOSE STANDARD INPUT AND ERROR ARE BOTH CONNECTED
       TO  TERMINALS  (AS DETERMINED BY ISATTY(3)), OR ONE STARTED WITH THE -I
       OPTION.  PS1 IS SET AND $- INCLUDES I IF BASH IS INTERACTIVE,  ALLOWING
       A SHELL SCRIPT OR A STARTUP FILE TO TEST THIS STATE.

       THE  FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBE HOW BASH EXECUTES ITS STARTUP FILES.
       IF ANY OF THE FILES EXIST BUT CANNOT BE READ, BASH  REPORTS  AN  ERROR.
       TILDES  ARE EXPANDED IN FILENAMES AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER TILDE EXPAN‐
       SION IN THE EXPANSION SECTION.

       WHEN BASH IS INVOKED AS AN INTERACTIVE LOGIN SHELL, OR AS A  NON-INTER‐
       ACTIVE  SHELL WITH THE --LOGIN OPTION, IT FIRST READS AND EXECUTES COM‐
       MANDS FROM THE FILE /ETC/PROFILE, IF THAT FILE EXISTS.   AFTER  READING
       THAT FILE, IT LOOKS FOR ~/.BASH_PROFILE, ~/.BASH_LOGIN, AND ~/.PROFILE,
       IN THAT ORDER, AND READS AND EXECUTES COMMANDS FROM THE FIRST ONE  THAT
       EXISTS  AND  IS  READABLE.  THE --NOPROFILE OPTION MAY BE USED WHEN THE
       SHELL IS STARTED TO INHIBIT THIS BEHAVIOR.

       WHEN A LOGIN SHELL EXITS, BASH READS AND  EXECUTES  COMMANDS  FROM  THE
       FILE ~/.BASH_LOGOUT, IF IT EXISTS.

       WHEN  AN  INTERACTIVE  SHELL THAT IS NOT A LOGIN SHELL IS STARTED, BASH
       READS AND EXECUTES COMMANDS FROM  /ETC/BASH.BASHRC  AND  ~/.BASHRC,  IF
       THESE  FILES  EXIST.  THIS MAY BE INHIBITED BY USING THE --NORC OPTION.
       THE --RCFILE FILE OPTION WILL FORCE BASH TO READ AND  EXECUTE  COMMANDS
       FROM FILE INSTEAD OF /ETC/BASH.BASHRC AND ~/.BASHRC.

       WHEN  BASH  IS  STARTED  NON-INTERACTIVELY,  TO RUN A SHELL SCRIPT, FOR
       EXAMPLE, IT LOOKS FOR THE VARIABLE BASH_ENV IN THE ENVIRONMENT, EXPANDS
       ITS  VALUE IF IT APPEARS THERE, AND USES THE EXPANDED VALUE AS THE NAME
       OF A FILE TO READ AND EXECUTE.  BASH BEHAVES AS IF THE  FOLLOWING  COM‐
       MAND WERE EXECUTED:
              IF [ -N "$BASH_ENV" ]; THEN . "$BASH_ENV"; FI
       BUT  THE VALUE OF THE PATH VARIABLE IS NOT USED TO SEARCH FOR THE FILE‐
       NAME.

       IF BASH IS INVOKED WITH THE NAME SH, IT  TRIES  TO  MIMIC  THE  STARTUP
       BEHAVIOR  OF  HISTORICAL  VERSIONS  OF SH AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE, WHILE
       CONFORMING TO THE POSIX STANDARD AS WELL.  WHEN INVOKED AS AN  INTERAC‐
       TIVE  LOGIN  SHELL, OR A NON-INTERACTIVE SHELL WITH THE --LOGIN OPTION,
       IT FIRST ATTEMPTS TO READ AND EXECUTE COMMANDS  FROM  /ETC/PROFILE  AND
       ~/.PROFILE,  IN  THAT  ORDER.   THE  --NOPROFILE  OPTION MAY BE USED TO
       INHIBIT THIS BEHAVIOR.  WHEN INVOKED AS AN INTERACTIVE SHELL  WITH  THE
       NAME  SH,  BASH  LOOKS FOR THE VARIABLE ENV, EXPANDS ITS VALUE IF IT IS
       DEFINED, AND USES THE EXPANDED VALUE AS THE NAME OF A FILE TO READ  AND
       EXECUTE.  SINCE A SHELL INVOKED AS SH DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO READ AND EXE‐
       CUTE COMMANDS FROM ANY OTHER STARTUP FILES, THE --RCFILE OPTION HAS  NO
       EFFECT.   A  NON-INTERACTIVE  SHELL  INVOKED  WITH THE NAME SH DOES NOT
       ATTEMPT TO READ ANY OTHER STARTUP FILES.   WHEN  INVOKED  AS  SH,  BASH
       ENTERS POSIX MODE AFTER THE STARTUP FILES ARE READ.

       WHEN  BASH  IS  STARTED IN POSIX MODE, AS WITH THE --POSIX COMMAND LINE
       OPTION, IT FOLLOWS THE POSIX STANDARD FOR STARTUP FILES.  IN THIS MODE,
       INTERACTIVE  SHELLS  EXPAND  THE ENV VARIABLE AND COMMANDS ARE READ AND
       EXECUTED FROM THE FILE WHOSE NAME IS  THE  EXPANDED  VALUE.   NO  OTHER
       STARTUP FILES ARE READ.

       BASH ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE WHEN IT IS BEING RUN WITH ITS STANDARD INPUT
       CONNECTED TO A NETWORK CONNECTION, AS WHEN EXECUTED BY THE REMOTE SHELL
       DAEMON,  USUALLY RSHD, OR THE SECURE SHELL DAEMON SSHD.  IF BASH DETER‐
       MINES IT IS BEING RUN IN THIS FASHION, IT READS AND  EXECUTES  COMMANDS
       FROM  ~/.BASHRC  AND  ~/.BASHRC, IF THESE FILES EXIST AND ARE READABLE.
       IT WILL NOT DO THIS IF INVOKED AS SH.  THE --NORC OPTION MAY BE USED TO
       INHIBIT  THIS  BEHAVIOR,  AND  THE --RCFILE OPTION MAY BE USED TO FORCE
       ANOTHER FILE TO BE READ, BUT NEITHER RSHD NOR SSHD GENERALLY INVOKE THE
       SHELL WITH THOSE OPTIONS OR ALLOW THEM TO BE SPECIFIED.

       IF THE SHELL IS STARTED WITH THE EFFECTIVE USER (GROUP) ID NOT EQUAL TO
       THE REAL USER (GROUP) ID, AND THE -P OPTION IS NOT SUPPLIED, NO STARTUP
       FILES ARE READ, SHELL FUNCTIONS ARE NOT INHERITED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT,
       THE SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH,  AND  GLOBIGNORE  VARIABLES,  IF  THEY
       APPEAR  IN  THE  ENVIRONMENT, ARE IGNORED, AND THE EFFECTIVE USER ID IS
       SET TO THE REAL USER ID.  IF THE -P OPTION IS SUPPLIED  AT  INVOCATION,
       THE  STARTUP  BEHAVIOR  IS  THE  SAME, BUT THE EFFECTIVE USER ID IS NOT
       RESET.

DEFINITIONS
       THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE REST  OF  THIS  DOCU‐
       MENT.
       BLANK  A SPACE OR TAB.
       WORD   A  SEQUENCE  OF  CHARACTERS  CONSIDERED  AS A SINGLE UNIT BY THE
              SHELL.  ALSO KNOWN AS A TOKEN.
       NAME   A WORD CONSISTING ONLY OF  ALPHANUMERIC  CHARACTERS  AND  UNDER‐
              SCORES,  AND BEGINNING WITH AN ALPHABETIC CHARACTER OR AN UNDER‐
              SCORE.  ALSO REFERRED TO AS AN IDENTIFIER.
       METACHARACTER
              A CHARACTER THAT, WHEN UNQUOTED, SEPARATES WORDS.   ONE  OF  THE
              FOLLOWING:
              |  & ; ( ) < > SPACE TAB
       CONTROL OPERATOR
              A TOKEN THAT PERFORMS A CONTROL FUNCTION.  IT IS ONE OF THE FOL‐
              LOWING SYMBOLS:
              || & && ; ;; ( ) | |& <NEWLINE>

RESERVED WORDS
       RESERVED WORDS ARE WORDS THAT HAVE A SPECIAL MEANING TO THE SHELL.  THE
       FOLLOWING WORDS ARE RECOGNIZED AS RESERVED WHEN UNQUOTED AND EITHER THE
       FIRST WORD OF A SIMPLE COMMAND (SEE SHELL GRAMMAR BELOW) OR  THE  THIRD
       WORD OF A CASE OR FOR COMMAND:

       !  CASE   COPROC   DO  DONE ELIF ELSE ESAC FI FOR FUNCTION IF IN SELECT
       THEN UNTIL WHILE { } TIME [[ ]]

SHELL GRAMMAR
   SIMPLE COMMANDS
       A SIMPLE COMMAND IS A SEQUENCE OF OPTIONAL  VARIABLE  ASSIGNMENTS  FOL‐
       LOWED  BY  BLANK-SEPARATED  WORDS AND REDIRECTIONS, AND TERMINATED BY A
       CONTROL OPERATOR.  THE FIRST WORD SPECIFIES THE COMMAND TO BE EXECUTED,
       AND  IS  PASSED  AS  ARGUMENT  ZERO.  THE REMAINING WORDS ARE PASSED AS
       ARGUMENTS TO THE INVOKED COMMAND.

       THE RETURN VALUE OF A SIMPLE COMMAND IS ITS EXIT STATUS,  OR  128+N  IF
       THE COMMAND IS TERMINATED BY SIGNAL N.

   PIPELINES
       A  PIPELINE  IS  A SEQUENCE OF ONE OR MORE COMMANDS SEPARATED BY ONE OF
       THE CONTROL OPERATORS | OR |&.  THE FORMAT FOR A PIPELINE IS:

              [TIME [-P]] [ ! ] COMMAND [ [|⎪|&] COMMAND2 ... ]

       THE STANDARD OUTPUT OF COMMAND IS CONNECTED VIA A PIPE TO THE  STANDARD
       INPUT  OF  COMMAND2.   THIS CONNECTION IS PERFORMED BEFORE ANY REDIREC‐
       TIONS SPECIFIED BY THE COMMAND (SEE REDIRECTION BELOW).  IF |& IS USED,
       COMMAND'S  STANDARD  ERROR, IN ADDITION TO ITS STANDARD OUTPUT, IS CON‐
       NECTED TO COMMAND2'S STANDARD INPUT THROUGH THE PIPE; IT  IS  SHORTHAND
       FOR  2>&1  |.   THIS  IMPLICIT REDIRECTION OF THE STANDARD ERROR TO THE
       STANDARD OUTPUT IS PERFORMED AFTER ANY REDIRECTIONS  SPECIFIED  BY  THE
       COMMAND.

       THE RETURN STATUS OF A PIPELINE IS THE EXIT STATUS OF THE LAST COMMAND,
       UNLESS THE PIPEFAIL OPTION IS ENABLED.  IF  PIPEFAIL  IS  ENABLED,  THE
       PIPELINE'S  RETURN  STATUS IS THE VALUE OF THE LAST (RIGHTMOST) COMMAND
       TO EXIT WITH A NON-ZERO STATUS, OR ZERO IF ALL COMMANDS  EXIT  SUCCESS‐
       FULLY.  IF THE RESERVED WORD !  PRECEDES A PIPELINE, THE EXIT STATUS OF
       THAT PIPELINE IS THE LOGICAL NEGATION OF THE EXIT STATUS  AS  DESCRIBED
       ABOVE.   THE  SHELL WAITS FOR ALL COMMANDS IN THE PIPELINE TO TERMINATE
       BEFORE RETURNING A VALUE.

       IF THE TIME RESERVED WORD PRECEDES A PIPELINE, THE ELAPSED AS  WELL  AS
       USER  AND  SYSTEM  TIME CONSUMED BY ITS EXECUTION ARE REPORTED WHEN THE
       PIPELINE TERMINATES.  THE -P OPTION CHANGES THE OUTPUT FORMAT  TO  THAT
       SPECIFIED  BY POSIX.  WHEN THE SHELL IS IN POSIX MODE, IT DOES NOT REC‐
       OGNIZE TIME A
